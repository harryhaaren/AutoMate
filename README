					AutoMate

The idea behind this project is that there are a lot of seperate
programs out there for linux audio use, and for each one to implement
an automation editor & recorder would be pointless. So i took the liberty
to try an pen one myself. I hope its useful to some of you.

The user interface should be very self explanatory, there's an automation
line, and that "read" by the playhead (the red line), and the value is
then sent out via Jack MIDI. Simple huh?

All feedback / bugs / feature requests to: harryhaaren@gmail.com

Cheers, -Harry van Haaren
